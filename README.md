# Project2-Books
A GitHub Repository for my second project in my Data Science Programming Class

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook file developed for webscraping the website books.toscrape. In this project I scraped 5 different categories within the website. With these categories, I listed the Book Names, Prices, and Availability. Using those values, I answered 4 questions:
1. What books (if any) are unavailable?
2. What is the amount of books found on each website?
3. What is the percentage of each price range?
4. What is the website with the most books?

Websites used:
https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/classics_6/index.html
https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/historical-fiction_4/index.html
https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/philosophy_7/index.html
https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/music_14/index.html
https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/poetry_23/index.html

These are the project directions:
From the website of your choice, setup a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages. Place the data in a pandas DataFrame, clean the data, if necessary, and then perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data.

Answers should be given programmatically as output and at least two questions should have answers demonstrated via a plot.

Seaborn should be used to plot your analysis. Your plots should include data labels, and a title that summarizes your conclusion, and, styling should be applied.
